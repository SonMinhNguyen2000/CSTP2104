**We are building a student Advisory/Management Application with the following features.**
1. We need to save, edit, delete, search and list the student
2. For students who are registered in a specific degree, diploma or certificate program, we want an application that provides the students with available and enroll able courses for a term
   - Available means that the course is going to run on a specific date/time(year, semester)
   - Enroll able means that based on students previous courses give the courses which the student can enroll in.
